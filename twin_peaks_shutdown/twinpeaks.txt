How have Twin Peaks shuttles affected other routes?

As reported in Mission Local, the operator shortage caused by the twin-peaks shutdown
has resulted in a silent Muni meltdown - it's not you - there's a service reduction everywhere!

Although one might expect diesel bus routes to be most affected, the shortage isn't of buses,
but of operators, so all routes are affected. Given the different nature of rail operations,
we'll only be looking at bus routes (trolley and diesel), excluding the NX.

To visualize the impact, we'll show the average # of scheduled and actual vehicles in service for
a given route for each weekday and weekend/holiday during the shutdown (June 25 - August 25)
and right before (April 25 - June 24).



Implementation

OpenTransit has a data-store containing the real-time vehicle of all Muni vehicles since November 2017.
This data comes from pinging Nextbus every 15 seconds, where actual vehicle GPS locations are updated
between 30 and 120 seconds. We plan on using the GPS data stored onboard vehicles once we obtain AVL
data from Muni.

Our data-store can be accessed via our GraphQL API here - note that there are data gaps between
February and April. This analysis is from May 25 to July 25 (one normal month + one twin-peaks),
so there should be no data discrepencies other than the occasional Nextbus downtime.

We first wrote a batch that queried our API and outputted a JSON file containing the time and vehicle_id
of every start of a trip for each route for each day in the date range. You can access the file here.
